= OperaWatir

== Description

OperaWatir is our implementation of the {Watir
API}[http://wtr.rubyforge.org/rdoc/1.6.5/], originally developed for
Internet Explorer by an independent third-party.  This documentation
will describe how to get OperaWatir running on your machine and how to
write and run tests with it.

Watir (pronounced water) is an acronym for “Web Application Testing in
Ruby”, and is comprised of a toolkit used to automate interactions with
web browsers.  Watir was originally conceived to to test web
applications, but Opera Software have since expanded it and made it
useful also for doing automated testing of the browser itself.  Using
OperaWatir will allow you to drive the Opera web browser as well as
extracting useful information for testing that the browser renderer
behaves properly.
