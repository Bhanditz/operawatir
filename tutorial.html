<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
  The Watir API allows you to write scripts that interact with
  any web page.  Its primary purpose is to ease test
  automation for web applications.  Your scripts can, for
  example, before you deploy automatically go through all the
  steps your users normally would and alert you of any
  regressions.
</p>

<p>
  In this tutorial we are going to control Google Maps. We will find
  directions from the Opera headquarters to the Oslo Opera House, and then we
  will take a closer look at our destination.
</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>First make sure you have installed OperaWatir. If you have trouble check
that you have all the <a href="TODO LINK HERE">requirements [TODO]</a>, and if
you still cannot get it working try contacting us on our
<a href="https://list.opera.com/mailman/listinfo/operawatir-users">mailing list</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="prompt"><span class="prompt">%</span> jruby -S gem install operawatir
<span class="prompt">%</span> operawatir --help</code></pre>

<h3>The beginning</h3>

<p>In every script you will first need to require OperaWatir, and then start
Opera. Pretty soon after that you will want to visit a URL. This is simply
achieved by setting the <code>url</code> property on the <code>browser</code> object.
Finally we need to quit the browser.</p>

<pre><code>require 'operawatir'

browser = OperaWatir::Browser.new
browser.url = 'http://maps.google.com'

browser.quit
</code></pre>

<p>Save this code into a file called <strong><code>tutorial.rb</code></strong>, and then you run
it using this command:</p>

<pre><code class="prompt"><span class="prompt">%</span> jruby tutorial.rb</code></pre>

<p>Opera will start, wait a moment, and then go and visit Google Maps, and quit.
Now that we can visit any page we want, it is time to interact with them!</p>

<h3>Finding elements</h3>

<aside>
 <p id="congratulations">You can find the ID of an element in Opera by right
  clicking it, selecting ‘Inspect Element’, and looking for the
  <code>id="…"</code> attribute in the window that appears. Try finding my ID!</p>
</aside>

<p>To interact with the page you first need to find the element you want to use.
You can then perform a variety of actions of which the most common are clicking
and typing in text. Take a look at the <a href="TODO">API Documentation [TODO]</a>
for more.</p>

<p>In this example we are going to type in the Google Maps search field. There
are two things you need to find an element with Watir: the type of
element, and an identifying feature. The easiest way to uniquely identify an
element is by using the ID, for the search field this is “<code>q_d</code>”.
This is also a text box and so we use the <code>text_field</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>search = browser.text_field(:id, 'q_d')</code></pre>

<p>Check out the <a href="TODO">documentation [TODO]</a> to see the other
elements you can find.</p>

<p>Now that we have the search box we want to type something in it.</p>

<h3>The keyboard</h3>

<p>We can type text by using the <code>set</code> method, and press ‘special’
keys by using the <code>key</code> method. We will use these methods to search
for the directions from Opera HQ to the Opera House, and submit the form by
pressing the enter key. Including our progress so far this gives us the following code:</p>

<pre><code>require 'operawatir'

browser = OperaWatir::Browser.new
browser.url = 'http://maps.google.com'

# Find the search box
search = browser.text_field(:id, 'q_d')

# Type text and submit the form
search.set 'Opera Software ASA, Oslo to Den Norske Opera & Ballett'
browser.key('Enter')

# Wait 3 seconds so that we can see the results
sleep 3

browser.quit</code></pre>

<p>Try saving this code and running the script using the command in the above
section. After loading Google Maps, Opera will wait a bit, and then start typing,
and press enter. The <code>sleep 3</code> will keep Opera open long enough for
you to see that our search was ambiguous, and we need to click the first result.</p>

<h3>The mouse</h3>

<p>Clicking links is very simple and uses some of the techniques we have already
learned. First we need to find the link to click, and then we can call the
<code>click</code> method.</p>

<p>In our search the first suggested result is correct, which always has the ID
of <code>ddw_dll_1_0</code>. Using the <code>link</code> method to search for
only links, results in:</p>

<pre><code>browser.link(:id, 'ddw_dll_1_0').click</code></pre>

<p>Put this after the <code>sleep 3</code> above.</p>

<h3>Difficult elements</h3>

<p>Sometimes the element you want does not have an ID. In these cases we need to
use other tools. First check if the element has a unique <code>title</code> or
<code>name</code>. Or, if you know it will always be in
the same position you search by its index.</p>

<pre><code># Examples of alternative selectors
labs_image = browser.image(:title, 'Google Maps Labs')
search_button = browser.button(:name, 'btnG')
web_link = browser.link(:index, 2) # second link on the page</code></pre>

<p>If you still cannot locate the element using these you can use
<strong>XPath</strong>. XPath is can be very complicated, but we will be using
only the simple selector <code>//div[@log='pan_down']</code>.
This selects all the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements whose <code>log</code> attribute equals
'<code>pan_down</code>'. In this case there is only one: the pan down button
located at the top left of the map. </p>

<pre><code>pan_down = browser.element_by_xpath("//div[@log='pan_down']")
zoom_in = browser.element_by_xpath("//div[@title='Zoom In']")</code></pre>

<p>To have a look at our destination we are going to pan down once, and then click
the Zoom In button twice.</p>

<h3>Final code</h3>

<p>Here is the complete code. Because Google Maps is an AJAX application we
have added <code>sleep</code>s to make sure things have loaded and been added
to the DOM before we try and find them.</p>

<pre><code>require 'operawatir'

browser = OperaWatir::Browser.new
browser.url = 'http://maps.google.com/'

puts 'Find the search box'
search = browser.text_field(:id, 'q_d')

puts 'Type text and submit the form'
search.set 'Opera Software ASA, Oslo to Den Norske Opera & Ballett'
browser.key('Enter')

sleep 1

puts 'Select the first result'
browser.link(:id, 'ddw_dll_1_0').click

sleep 2

puts 'Pan down'
pan_down = browser.element_by_xpath("//div[@log='pan_down']")
pan_down.click

puts 'Zoom in'
zoom_in = browser.element_by_xpath("//div[@title='Zoom In']")
zoom_in.click
zoom_in.click

puts 'Done'

sleep 10

# End
browser.quit</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<aside><p>If you want something else to try, see if you can close the left panel (hint:
it is an image with an ID of <code>panelarrow2</code>).</p></aside>

<p>Hopefully this has been an enjoyable introduction to OperaWatir, and has shown
you how easy it is to automatically control the browser. And you are not limited
to what has been demonstrated here, have a look at the
<a href="TODO">API Documentation [TODO]</a> to see everything you can do.</p>

<p>Happy testing and automating!</p>
