v0.4.1.pre3  2011-03-14

  [API CHANGES]

  * window.element (and browser.element if you're running in
    compatibility mode) now works.  Fixes backwards compatibility for
    SPARTAN tests.  Related to WTR-260.  (andreastt)

  * :selector has now been added as a basic type in Watir 2
    compatibility mode (e.g. element(:css, 'foo')).  This is aliased to
    :css.  Added method Compat::Collection#find_elements_by_selector as
    alias to Collection#find_by_css.  (andreastt)

  * Element#get_hash is now alias to Element#visual_hash for backwards
    compatiblity with WTR-260.  (andreastt)

  * Window#get_hash is now aliased to Window#visual_hash for backwards
    compatibility with WTR-260.  (andreastt)

  * Compat::Browser#quit is no longer needed, removed method.  We no
    longer use Browser#quit! which it was an alias for.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * New command-line option --tag (or -t for short) for specifying to
    run only tagged tests.  Adding ~ (tilde) before the tag (e.g. ~slow)
    will exclude given tests.

  * New command-line option --backtrace (or -b for short) for enabling
    full backtraces from RSpec.  As a result, --binary has lost its
    shortcut -b.  (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Upgraded to OperaDriver v0.4.2.pre5.  (andreastt)

  * Added specifications tests for Desktop part of OperaWatir.  (karie,
    mariap)

  * OperaWatir specification tests for Desktop are now using RSpec
    matchers.  Makes it easier to expect windows to be closed, opened,
    &c.  (karie)

  * --no-opera-idle has been renamed to --opera-idle.  OperaIdle is now
    by default switched off due to instability.  (andreastt)

  * desktopwatir is no longer writing to STDERR, but to STDOUT.
    (andreastt)

  * Synced operawatir and desktopwatir binaries.  (andreastt)

  * Updated /spec/watir2/element_spec.rb to HEAD from watirspec.
    (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Window#get_hash and Element#get_hash methods are now marked as
    deprecated.

  * Resolved failing to activate address field will use the current
    control without any errors.  Fixes DSK-320799.  (karie)

  * Widgets should return widgets listing from active Document Window.
    Fixes DSK-330102.  (karie)

  * Renamed paramter in DesktopBrowser#widgets since it's not
    necessarily the window name the user will be looking for.  (karie)

  * Added more load actions to be handled by load_window_with_action.
    Fixes DSK-320817.  (karie)

  * Failing to activate address field will use the current control
    without any errors.  Focus moved from edit_field to its subclass
    before call to enter text.  Fixes DSK-320799.  (karie)

  * Defaulting to active window when Document Window is specified, fixed
    to only default when active window is actually a Document Window.
    Related to DSK-320786.  (karie)

  * Documentation fixes in Desktop code.  (karie)

  [OTHER]

  * Updated /README.me with the latest version requirements.
  (andreastt)

v0.4.1.pre2  2011-03-08

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Stringifying text before splitting it in Element#text=.  Thanks to
    Hallvord R. M. Steen.  (andreastt)

  * Depending on RSpec v2.4 or above, not v2.5 or less as we did
    previously.  This resolves upgrading OperaWatir if you already have
    an ancient version of RSpec installed (like we did on SPARTAN).
    (andreastt)

v0.4.1.pre1  2011-03-04

  [API CHANGES]

  * Dropped support for Browser#build.  (wilhelmja)

  * Moved deprecated keyboard interaction methods (Window#key,
    Window#key_down, Window#key_up, Window#type) from Window to Browser.
    If you're running operawatir in Watir 2 compatibility mode (which is
    enabled by default), this won't change anything for you.
    (andreastt)

  * Added a new preferences API which is accessible from
    browser.preferences.  Removed Browser#set_preference,
    Browser#get_default_preference and Browser#get_preference.
    (andreastt)

  * Added Browser#build.  (wilhelmja)

  * Removed Browser#pid.  (wilhelmja)

  * Removed Browser#goto.  It's still available in Browser::Compat#goto,
    which is included by default.  (andreastt)

  * Added DesktopBrowser#get_preference, DesktopBrowser#set_preference
    and DesktopBrowser#get_default_preference.  (karie)

  * Removed Browser#exists? and Browser#connected?.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Support for disabling OperaIdle with --no-opera-idle.  (andreastt)

  * Added option to wait for connection from Opera.  operawatir binary
    now accepts --manual (or -m for short).  This will allow you to go
    to opera:debug and hit connect manually.  (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Updated OperaDriver to v0.4.2.pre2.  (andreastt)

  * Added tests for deprecated method Window#eval_js.  (wilhelmja)

  * Added deprecation notice to Element#compare_hash.  (andreastt)

  * Added specification tests for Window#screenshot,
    Element#triple_click, Element#compare_hash.  (wilhelmja)

  * Added more specification tests for Window#quadruple_click.
    (andreastt)

  * DesktopBrowser is now using guessOperaPath from OperaDriver.
    (karie)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fixed passing wrong variable (param instead of args) in
    Browser#opera_action.  This fixes browser.opera_action('foo').
    (wilhelmja)

  * Browser#ua_string now returns the navigator.userAgent value from
    JavaScript.  (wilhelmja)

  * Browser#platform now returns the navigator.platform value from
    JavaScript.  (wilhelmja)

  * Compat::Element#text now supports getting texteditable values from
    input, textarea and select elements.  (andreastt)

  * Requiring stringio as JRuby apparently doesn't by default, fixes
    problem with RSpec formatters.  (andreastt)

  * Colours are now enabled by default, even on Windows.  Installing the
    gem `ansicolor' fixes colour problems on Windows.  (andreastt)

  * --output now writes to a file, was broken when upgrading to RSpec
    v2.5.  (andreastt)

  * --format was not working, fixed.  (andreastt)

  * Now requiring RSpec v2.5, not v2.5.1.  rspec-core is v2.5.1, but the
    main gem, rspec, is only 2.5.  (andreastt)

  * operawatir-launched tests now write to STDOUT instead of STDERR.
    (andreastt)

  * Check that Browser#desktop? actually returns true or false.
    (wilhelmja)

  * Check that Window#visual_hash and Element#visual_hash returns a hash
    in the correct format 8an md5sum preceded by 0x.  (wilhelmja)

  * Added tests for Window#visual_hash and Browser#desktop?.
    (wilhelmja)

  * Misc. test name fixes.  (wilhelmja)

  * Removing Ruby platform dependency.  (andreastt)

  * We need to exit forcibly (I think because of RSpec) when we come to
    the end of the test suite.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed compat problem and changed autostart fix to use empty Opera
    path instead of separate setting.  (karie)

  * Super goto (in DesktopBrowser) disappeared, so don't use it.

  [OTHER]

  * Updated /README.md with the latest version requirements.
    (andreastt)

  * Updated documentation in /README.md.  Also added a new section
    listing the operawatir binary's option list.  (andreastt)

  * Set up framework for OperaWatir-specific specification tests.
    (andreastt)

  * Renamed /spec/legacy_watirspec to /spec/watir2.  (andreastt)

  * Renamed /spec/new_watirspec to /spec/watir3.  (andreastt)
